# Preparing accounts to hand over to accountants

The process for getting everything ready so you can hand over to your accountant so they can prepare your accounts and file them with HMRC is documented here.

(The process for filling in your own tax return yourself is documented in this repo, based on the FocusHub business.)

**DISCLAIMER: this information is based on dwyl's accounts only and should not be considered general financial advice. You are responsible for ensuring your own accounts are correctly prepared.**

## Overview

You should be aware (or make a decision with your accountants) whether you'll be doing `cash accounting` or `accrual accounting`. 

The difference is explained [here](https://www.xero.com/uk/resources/small-business-guides/accounting/cash-vs-accrual-accounting/), for example. 
The upshot is, are you booking your revenue/expenses when the money goes in/out of your bank account (cash basis), or when you raise an invoice / receive a bill (accrual basis). Discuss what's best for your business with your accountant.

_This document is for **cash accounting**, which the easier of the two processes._ (Since we're using the Xero accounting tool, the process is pretty simple either way)

With your accounting basis decided, everything else is done within the Xero accounting system. 

All this entails is categorising all income and expenditure to the right account (e.g. Sales, VAT, Office supplies), assigning the correct tax rate, and reconciling the bank transaction against an invoice or receipt.

## 1. Preparing for the last day of the financial year

Using cash accounting, payments you make on the last day of the financial year will be counted as part of that year; 
payments you make the next day (first day of the new year) will be counted as part of the next financial year. 
This can obviously make a huge difference to your final accounts (i.e. to the amount of corporation tax you pay), so you should discuss what's optimal with your accountant or bookkeeper.

If the answer is that you want to put as much **revenue** as possible into this year, you'll want to start chasing clients for unpaid invoices so they're paid _before_ 30th April

Alternatively, if you want to put as much **expenditure** as possible into this year, you'll want to pay suppliers before 30th April 

(There are other reasons for going one way or the other, for example you might have cashflow issues. Discuss this with your accountant.)

Since the end of our financial year coincides with the end of a VAT quarter, we also have the flexibility to pay our VAT bill immediately on the 30th of April, or later (deadline 7th May).

## 2. Checklist for last day of the year - two months out

Let's assume you want to put as much expenditure as possible into this financial year. 

You should start this process _at least_ two months before the end of the year.

* [ ] Chase freelancers to submit their invoices (especially if they have a backlog)
* [ ] Chase staff to submit their expenses receipts; review and approve claims
* [ ] Review planned expenditure and see if any can be brought forward (e.g. if you're planning on buying company stationery/merch/etc., now's a good time)
* [ ] Get ahead on the VAT return, ensuring all transactions have the correct VAT recorded.

## 3. Checklist for last day of the year - on the day

* [ ] Pay all outstanding supplier invoices
* [ ] Pay all expense claims
* [ ] Submit VAT return and pay HMRC
* [ ] Run payroll (you'll be doing this anyway as it's the last day of the month)
* [ ] If you like, you can make a manual payment to our pension provider as well

If you've ticked all of this off, you're in a really good place. Even better, the final accounts don't need to be filed with HMRC until the end of January (so with the accountants mid-January)!

## 4. Reconciling transactions on Xero checklist

Yes, you have time, but don't slack now! You can get started on reconciling transactions - this means finding a bank transaction, categorising it to the right account (e.g. Sales, VAT, Office supplies), and assigning the correct tax rate.

* [ ] Reconcile all basic transactions according to the reconciliation process outlined in this repo
* [ ] Reconcile all payroll payments granularly (this is also described in this repo, but may not be necessary if you've already been doing it on a monthly basis)
* [ ] Reconcile any "special" transactions which require more attention. (e.g. refunds from pension scheme opt-outs)
  * (Complicated things like dividend payments can be left to the professional accountants)
* [ ] Check whether any transactions have been coded to our `suspense account` (850), which is basically a holding area for stuff you weren't ready to reconcile at the time

## 5. Accountants

If you've completed the checklist above, your part is almost done. The next step is to send the accountants our bank statements and give them access to Xero - and then be on hand to answer any queries they might have.

* [ ] Export bank statements up to 30th April of the financial year
* [ ] (As a `user admin`) Go to `Xero > Organisation settings > Users` and check if your accountant is already set up. 
  * If not, you can easily set them up in the `adviser` role, and give them `payroll admin` permissions ("Invite new user" button, top right)
  
Once you've answered all of the accountants' questions that's it for another year! Except...
