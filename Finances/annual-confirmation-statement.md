# Filing your annual confirmation statement with Companies House

## Background

You need to check that the information Companies House has about your company is correct every year. 
This is called a confirmation statement (previously an annual return).

Completing the form couldn't be easier, if you do it online (also it costs £40 to file on paper vs £13 online).

## Process

You'll need to do this once a year, or as and when relevant changes happen to your company / personnnel.

* Log into Companies House
* Hit "File Confirmation Statement" on the main page, and then `Start`
* Check if you want to change the date of your statement from the default (today's) date
