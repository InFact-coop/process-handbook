# Writing Legal Documents

Our current list of legal documents is as follows:
- Contractor Agreement
  - This is the agreement we use for all of our contractors (developers).
- Supplier Agreement
  - This is the agreement we use for all of our client projects
- Employment Agreement
  - This is the agreement we use for all of our employees
- Consulting Agreement
  - This is the agreement we use for consulting, training and workshops
- Data Agreement
  - This is the agreement we use for protecting sensitive company data

  These legal documents are constantly reviewed and updated as needs and changes arise.

  We've created an automated legal document creation system using the Google Store App AutoCrat to utilise Google Docs templates and Google Sheets to merge in contract data. This is beneficial for a number of reasons:
  1. It minimises errors in documents
  2. It provides us with a list of all of our documents and the important data within them
  3. It ensures the master template file is always the most up-to-date and newer versions of the documents will always be created from the continuously updated template file

# Ratification

Any document signed as a deed must be signed with wet ink. Otherwise we often employ the use of electronic signatures, most commonly using a Mac's inbuilt preview signature feature.

# Filing
If you need to scan a document, [CamScanner](https://www.camscanner.com/) is a useful mobile tool to do so. All of our legal documents are currently stored in Google Drive.

# Trademarks
We currently have three trademarks. These are as follows:
1. A word mark, "DWYL" https://trademarks.ipo.gov.uk/ipo-tmcase/page/Results/1/UK00003103535
2. A colour image mark for the dwyl heart logo
https://trademarks.ipo.gov.uk/ipo-tmcase/page/Results/1/UK00003211728
3. A black and white image mark for the dwyl heart logo
https://trademarks.ipo.gov.uk/ipo-tmcase/page/Results/1/UK00003211728

The black and white (3) mark protects us against all colour variants and the teal mark (2) provides even further and specific protection for those who use similar colours to us in a similar logo.

Trademarks must be actively protected in order to ensure their validity.

Trademarks can be applied for here:

They can be expanded internationally by means of the Madrid Protocol here:
