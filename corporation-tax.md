# Corporation Tax

Generally we pay accountants to file our annual company accounts and calculate the Corporation Tax for us.

With FocusHub, however, they are simple enough for us to file ourselves - which is why it's worth capturing the process here.

### Before you start

* Identify the period you're filing for
* Filter whatever accounting platform (Xero, FreeAgent) we're using to only include the period you're filing for
* Ensure all transactions during that period (money in or out) have been reconciled, categorised to the correct account (e.g. office supplies, travel), and with the right VAT rate
  * In Xero this is easily done by looking at `account transactions` - the column on the right tells you whether something is reconcoled or not
  * In FreeAgent it's slightly trickier - you need to make sure to check each transaction category in the dropdown (screenshot) as FreeAgent has a habit of "hiding" things

### HMRC

(This process is written with FocusHub in mind)

* Log in to the relevant HMRC account. The details are in the usual spreadsheet.
  * NB: 2FA is enabled; the dwyl accounts have @iteles mobile registered, and the FocusHub accounts have @rub1e mobile registered. So best to check the relevant person is available to send you the security code
* Hit `Complete corporation tax return` and press `continue` until you see a green button that says `Create New Submission`
* "No - I don't want to amend an existing Company Tax Return"
* "No - my accounts haven't been audited"
* "Private limited company"
* "No - my company is not one of these" (insurance, investment, credit, property)
* "No - my company is not part of a group"
* "Yes - my company is registered in the UK"
* "No - I don't need to report these" (currency, adjustments, instruments, restructuring)
* "No - I don't need to report any of these things" (shares stuff)
* "No - I don't need to report investment assets" 
* "No - I don't need to report contingent assets"
* "No - I don't need to report these"
* "No - I don't need to claim capital allowances"
* `Who do you want to file to?` - "Companies House and HMRC"
* Company reg number is on Companies House, and authentication code is in the usual spreadsheet, but next to Companies House not HMRC
* Continue and check/confirm the filing period dates
* "No - my company wasn't dormant"
* Answers to "about your business" should be obvious
* `What type of accounts have you prepared?` - "Microentity Accounts"
* Now you're ready to... *begin* the process...

### Return

Here comes the Maths bit - concentrate...

Start with running a Profit & Loss report fixed to the dates of the filing period. (`Reports > P&L`)

* "No - I haven't prepared a directors' report"
* Turnover - Also called sales, revenue or income. The total amount this period from selling goods or services, not including VAT.
  * On FreeAgent this is just called `Turnover` at the top of the report
