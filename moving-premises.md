# Moving premises checklist

A checklist of things we have to do in order to move office, with links to relevant previous issues.

Based on: https://github.com/dwyl/hq/issues/469 and https://github.com/dwyl/focus-hub/issues/135

Ideally this would be started **more than 30 days** before we move out because some e.g. utilities providers have notice periods.

You should also try to get the details of the new tenants as many providers will ask this, and not having it can cause delays.

NB: when we left FocusHub we moved into Space4, which is a serviced co-working office - so we cancelled the various utilities rather than transferring them to the new address

* Contact our contents insurer to change the address on the account ([issue](https://github.com/dwyl/hq/issues/256))
  * In the unlikely event we have building cover, that should be dealt with as well
* Change address on Santander account (this takes ages and has to be done on paper via snail mail, with physical signatures)
* Change address on Coop account (account-holder has to call telephone banking)
* Change address on The People's Pension (email from registered address)
* Change address on HMRC & Companies House
  * NB: HMRC has several addresses that need to be changed individually; they're all on the same page, but they're easy to miss
* Change address on dwyl Google Admin Account
* Change address on Xero (`Xero > Settings > General Settings > Organisation Details`)
* Change address on invoicing template (in the invoicing folder. The template is used by a spreadsheet so don't touch anything other than the address)
* Change address on Google search (I just searched for dwyl and hit "edit your information" on the right hand side)
* If rent is paid through `direct debit`, cancel the instruction
* If we have a cleaner, inform them sooner rather than later; also worth checking if they can do a deep clean after we've moved our stuff out
* If we pay business rates and we're moving to a different area...
  * inform our current council of our moving date and ask for a final invoice
  * inform our new council of tenancy start date and fill in any forms
* Change address/cancel Internet Service Provider (this will definitely have a notice period)
* Change address/cancel water/gas/electricity
* Get everyone to change their email signatures and redo https://github.com/dwyl/hq/issues/365
* Change the address on dwyl.com (check whether it's only in the footer)
