# Bookkeeping

Our bookkeeping is kept up to date in Xero, the majority of it has been done by our accountants at ihorizon. When working with the accountants you will need to provide information about transactions in order to assist in reconcilliations.

# Expenses

The expenses policy has yet to be finalised (https://github.com/dwyl/hq/issues/123), a draft can be found here:

# Contractor Invoicing

The MVP application is still being tested by @robstallion. Providing there are no issues this will become the sole method of contractors submitting invoices.

In order to pay invoices, a company director with knowledge of the work carried out must approve them in the invoicing spreadsheet here:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RYoaLBfHFi5KH8XoKfM55VEmlkeEyn2Mws_X4ya_PiU/edit#gid=1142431849

Following approval, invoices can be paid by logging into the Santander bank interface and using a payment reference corresponding to the dwyl invoice number. The invoice is then recorded as paid in the invoicing spreadsheet and the contractor is emailed to confirm their invoice has been paid, "*I can confirm that this invoice has now been paid. You should see the payment appear in your bank account within the next 24 hours.*"

# Grants & Tax Credits

We have applied for the ZEN Grants Scheme for Cycling. This is a scheme that grants businesses up to Â£2k towards promoting sustainable travel.

We are also currently looking into partnering with an organisation to claim R&D tax credits. This is still being looked into, possible partners to deliver this include Leyton, ihorizon and GrantTree.
