# Holidays

## Policy

dwyl asks dwylers to adhere to the conditions below when booking holiday. 

This is so we have adequate notice in order to ensure projects aren't affected. 

**dwylers on PAYE** have a set number of paid holiday days to take in a year, according to their contracts.

**Freelance dwylers** can take as much unpaid holiday as they like, as long as the conditions below are followed.

### Conditions

* To provide 10 working days of notice prior to taking up to 5 working days off
* To provide 15 working days of notice prior to taking more than 5 working days off

If you know your holiday will fall in the middle of a busy period, we'd really appreciate as much notice as possible :blush:

## Process

dwyl has two systems for booking holiday - `Xero` for PAYE dwylers which links into payroll, and `Hr.my` for freelance dwylers (because it's open-source and free)

### For freelancers

* Get login details for [Hr.my](https://hr.my) from your friendly `Ops` representative (@rub1e or someone similar)
* Log in

* Hit the `leave` nav button and hit `application` (screenshot)
