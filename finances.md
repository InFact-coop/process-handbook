# Finances

# What?

A document that summarises our current financial processes and systems.

# Why?

So that we have a record of our processes in case someone else other than the person who normally carries them out needs to do them.

# How?

By creating and writing this document and including it as part of our process handbook.


# Payroll

Payroll is currently processed on the last business day of the month, follow these steps to post a payrun:

1. Log in to Xero, click Payroll, click Pay Runs

2. The new payrun will be automatically selected under 'New Pay Run' - click Process Pay Run

3. Post the new pay run to Xero, you'll receive a message, "*Pay run successfully processed. Payroll expense journal has been posted automatically and now includes an automatic entry for any Employment Allowance, where applicable.*"

4. Log in to the Santander bank account

5. Make payments of the net income amount (amount after tax) to the respective individuals with the reference "DWYL SALARY"

6. Make a payment to HMRC CUMBERNAULD, where the payment
reference is **Accounts Office Reference Number** + YY/**YY** + **MM** (17 characters),
where YY/YY is the tax year and MM is the tax month, e.g. YY/YY = 17/18 and MM = 01.
**The tax month starts in April, i.e. April = 01**.  
The payment should equal the total of the following from the relevant payrun in Xero:
Income tax, Student Loan deductions, Employee National Insurance Contribution (NIC),
Employer NIC.  
**NOTE:** We have an [employment allowance of £3,000 _annually_](https://www.gov.uk/claim-employment-allowance).
This means that starting in April of _every_ year, we do not have to pay Employ***er*** NIC
until we get to that £3,000 sum. Once our employer NIC reaches £3,000, we need
to start paying it again.

7. Go back to Xero and click Options -> Email Payslips to email everyone a copy of their payslip

# Bookkeeping

Bookkeeping is the activity or occupation of keeping records of the financial affairs of a business. Our bookkeeping is kept up to date in Xero, the majority of it has been done by our accountants at iHorizon. When working with the accountants you will need to provide information about transactions in order to assist in reconciliations. A reconciliation is when a bank transaction is matched to a corresponding bill or invoice or marked and categorised appropriately according to the accounts. If not done by accountants., reconciliations can be done by a member of the team. Xero has many guides that explain how this is done: https://help.xero.com/uk/BankAccounts_Details_Reconciliation

# Expenses

The expenses policy can be found here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SeXnzTD4P-Ley-RfcEpM4X5aYgjB8SN9mwywtXMPi-o/edit. Expenses are captured in Xero according to the policy document.

# Contractor Invoicing

The MVP application (https://invoice.dwyl.com) is the method of contractors submitting invoices. This is a prototype which is in temporary use whilst Time is under construction.

In order to pay invoices, a company director with knowledge of the work carried out must approve them in the invoicing spreadsheet here:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RYoaLBfHFi5KH8XoKfM55VEmlkeEyn2Mws_X4ya_PiU/edit#gid=1142431849

Following approval, invoices can be paid by logging into the Santander bank interface and using a payment reference corresponding to the dwyl invoice number. The invoice is then recorded as paid in the invoicing spreadsheet and the contractor is emailed to confirm their invoice has been paid, "*I can confirm that this invoice has now been paid. You should see the payment appear in your bank account within the next 24 hours.*"

# Grants & Tax Credits

We have applied for the ZEN Grants Scheme for Cycling. This is a scheme that grants businesses up to £2k towards promoting sustainable travel.

We are also currently looking into partnering with an organisation to claim R&D tax credits. This is still being looked into, possible partners to deliver this include Leyton, ihorizon and GrantTree.

# Corporation Tax Return

Every year the company must file a CT600 corporation tax return. These instructions should be updated when we file the 16/17 accounts. Previous returns can be found here:

# Budgeting

We have yet to set annual / monthly budgets for activities (e.g. https://github.com/dwyl/hq/issues/331). Budgeting is currently decided on an ad hoc basis.

# Forecasting

We have yet to develop sophisticated forecasting tools; to do our current forecasting we are using Xero and management accounts.

# VAT return

We are currently on the quarterly VAT scheme. This means we must submit a VAT return every 3 months. This requires calculating our VAT spent on purchases and VAT received from client payments and calculating our claim total and payment required to be made. Our next return is due in early September - these instructions should be updated when this takes place.
