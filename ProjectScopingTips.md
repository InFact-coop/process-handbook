# Project Scoping Tips

## What?
A collection of tips and suggestions for communicating clearly and effectively with prospective clients or when scoping a new project/ brief.

## Why?
Language and delivery are incredibly powerful tools. It is important to use them both thoughtfully to avoid miscommunications and to ensure that expectations are managed well. The aim is that this will result in happy teams all around, no nasty surprises and professional standards.

## How?

These notes have been written in the context of a client meeting where you are discussing a project proposal. Some of these notes apply more specifically to a project proposal for a project that has already been started by the client and that dwyl is intercepting to complete. The involved parties are therefore the client and then the client's client which will be referred to as client 2.

## Outline the Structure of the Call

Creating structure to a call is both helpful for the client and you. It helps ensure that you both understand what to expect and as a result, hopefully if there's any confusion about this it can be caught before anyone becomes disappointed or confused.

Key points to punctuate the structure of the call are:

- The beginning
- If you are approaching the time at which the meeting is due to end but can foresee it over-running
- The actual end/ conclusion of the meeting

### Beginning

You may tell the client that your call will address the following:
- What stage the project is at so far? (Not just as a team but also in more detail technically)
- Trying to answer whether dwyl has the skills required to tackle the client's project
- Ensuring that promises/expectations are clear and can be met, and in the case where client 2 may already be involved, what client 2's expectations are and whether they're currently being (or are on target to be) met.
- The call will end with clear next steps for action.
