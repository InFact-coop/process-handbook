### Why?
Personas help a team connect with and better understand the end user of their product.
This is key to the success of the product for ensuring that it is built to
address the users needs' as opposed to fulfilling the subjective vision of the
creators or the convenience of the team building it. They help to focus a build
by providing a precise definition of a user, as opposed to a nebulous "person on
the site/app". Personas remind the team of the *motives* and reasons *why* users
want it to offer the functionality that is being built. Keeping these reasons at
the forefront of the teams mind can have significant impacts on the delivery of
the end product. Not convinced how the _why_ makes a difference, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfzpNVDzre0

### What?
A persona is a fictional character created to represent a user type that might
use a product in a similar way. The format in which they are written can vary
according to the needs of the project, this readme will focus on ["proto personas"](http://uxmag.com/articles/using-proto-personas-for-executive-alignment).
Proto personas are ideal for projects that are short of time/ allocated resources
but that want to get the core benefits that using personas has to offer.

### How?
A persona should include:

- Name, Category & Photo — names that are an alliteration with the group that
they represent are useful e.g. "Sophie, the Student". Accompany this with a photo
or illustration of them.
- Age
- Job Title / Company
- Background - given that personas represent a user type, think about what core
background characteristics or attributes might be typical for this kind of
persona. You may be able to recognise these user types from user research
interviews you've conducted.
- Why do they need your product? — What problems can your product solve for them?
Why would using your product benefit them?
- Pain points - What is it that they struggle with at the moment in the domain
of your product? What problems could you solve for them (even if it's not
currently being addressed by the product)? What might put them off of using your
product?

Once you've created your cards you should print them and display them on the wall
near your team. This means the team has easy access to remind themselves of them.
You should refer to your user personas when writing user stories to give specific
context for the purpose behind writing them.

The personas are also beneficial for introducing new team members or stakeholders
with your end user groups.

Personas can be tailored to the unique needs and goals of your project according
to what you see relevant. For example you might want to use a quantifiable pain
points scale:
